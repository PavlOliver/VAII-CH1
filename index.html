    <p>Irrigation (also referred to as watering) is the practice of applying controlled amounts of water to land to help
        grow crops, landscape plants, and lawns. Irrigation has been a key aspect of agriculture for over 5,000 years
        and has been developed by many cultures around the world. Irrigation helps to grow crops, maintain landscapes,
        and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during times of below-average rainfall. In addition to these
        uses, irrigation is also employed to protect crops from frost,[1] suppress weed growth in grain fields, and
        prevent soil consolidation. It is also used to cool livestock, reduce dust, dispose of sewage, and support
        mining operations. Drainage, which involves the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given location,
        is often studied in conjunction with irrigation.</p>
    <p>There are several methods of irrigation that differ in how water is supplied to plants. Surface irrigation, also
        known as gravity irrigation, is the oldest form of irrigation and has been in use for thousands of years. In
        sprinkler irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by
        overhead high-pressure water devices. Micro-irrigation is a system that distributes water under low pressure
        through a piped network and applies it as a small discharge to each plant. Micro-irrigation uses less pressure
        and water flow than sprinkler irrigation. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the root zone of plants.
        Subirrigation has been used in field crops in areas with high water tables for many years. It involves
        artificially raising the water table to moisten the soil below the root zone of plants.</p>
    <p>rrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from springs or by using wells), from surface water
        (withdrawn from rivers, lakes or reservoirs) or from non-conventional sources like treated wastewater,
        desalinated water, drainage water, or fog collection. Irrigation can be supplementary to rainfall, which is
        common in many parts of the world as rainfed agriculture, or it can be full irrigation, where crops rarely rely
        on any contribution from rainfall. Full irrigation is less common and only occurs in arid landscapes with very
        low rainfall or when crops are grown in semi-arid areas outside of rainy seasons.</p>
